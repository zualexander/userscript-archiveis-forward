# userscript-archiveis-forward
this userscript detects specifics of websites. 
if these specifics are fulfilled it takes the URL and opens archive.is and automatically submits the origin URL so you can read the article.

## installation

* Install Tampermonkey 
* Copy the source from `main.js`
* Open Tampermonkey in your browser and click the Add Script tab (icon with a plus symbol)
* Paste the source into the script window and hit save

## troubleshooting
as it manipulates the archive.is page at the moment, it might affect your usage of archive.is for other tasks. 
disable/enable the script in case something happens with that or other pages
